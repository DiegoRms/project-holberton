            <h1>Music</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The music is, according to the traditional definition of the term, the art of organizing sensible
                    and
                    logically
                    a coherent combination of sounds and silences respecting the principles fundamentals of melody,
                    harmony
                    and
                    rhythm, through the intervention of complex psychoanimic processes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Music is part of our lives almost since we are born, and for many it is considered the food of the soul.
                There
                are different types of music, and each person can vary in their tastes. The results of the research
                show
                that
                music is a powerful form of social expression that can reinforce stereotypes and favors the expression
                of
                one's
                identity.

                <br>
                But beyond the musical tastes, it is clear that the sensation of listening to music of our liking is
                unique
                and
                even indescribable. Music makes us feel incredible sensations and makes us feel different emotions:
                joy,
                ecstasy, happiness, sadness, love...
