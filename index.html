            <h1>Music</h1>

            <p>The music is, according to the traditional definition of the term, the art of organizing sensible
                and
                logically
                a coherent combination of sounds and silences respecting the principles fundamentals of melody,
                harmony
                and
                rhythm, through the intervention of complex psychoanimic processes.
            </p>

            <p>Music is part of our lives almost since we are born, and for many it is considered the food of the
                soul.
                There
                are different types of music, and each person can vary in their tastes. The results of the research
                show
                that
                music is a powerful form of social expression that can reinforce stereotypes and favors the
                expression
                of
                one's
                identity.

                <br>
                But beyond the musical tastes, it is clear that the sensation of listening to music of our liking
                is
                unique
                and
                even indescribable. Music makes us feel incredible sensations and makes us feel different emotions:
                joy,
                ecstasy, happiness, sadness, love...

            <h2>Musical style of the 80 '</h2>
            <p>
                The 1980s was the golden age of music. Great internationally recognized artists paid off for all
                tastes.

                Mercury knew how to become one of the most important figures of the 80 ', for his incredible voice and
                for being one of the first stars to recognize himself as a carrier of the HIV virus and to sing to
                death, rather to life, through songs that pierce to the bone like: "The Show Must Go On" and "Love of
                My Life".
                <br>
                For their part, the best representatives of rock and metal were: Guns N 'Roses, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe,
                Van Halen, Poison, Metallica, Aerosmith, INXS, U2, The Police and Depeche Mode, among others.
                <br>
                Those who opened the way to pop and alternative rock were: Lionel Richie, Madonna, Michael Jackson,
                Prince, George Michael, Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins, Brian Adams, REM, Peter
                Gabriel and Cindy Lauper, among others.</p>
