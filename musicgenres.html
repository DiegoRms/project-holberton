            <h1>Music genres</h1>
            <p>There is a great variety of musical genres, since music has evolved over time and each culture has
                developed
                its
                own musical styles.
            </p>
            <p>Below you can find some of the genres of music.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Música clásica</h3>
            <p> <strong> Classical music is a current that begins approximately in 1750 and ends in around 1820,
                </strong> in Europe. Nowadays this type of music is associated to serious people, because it is a cult
                style, typical of a
                very formal, refined and elitist environment. When someone imagines this type of music, the image of
                great orchestras, with many instruments, directed by the figure of a director, quickly comes to mind.
                The dress is formal, with an image of respect and seriousness. Classical music is expressed in concerts
                (soloist accompanying the orchestra) and symphonies (a chorus of voices and instruments). Some of its
                main authors are Wagner, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, etcetera.

            <h3>2. Jazz</h3>

            <p>The jazz is a genre of music that originated in various rhythms and melodies Afro - Americans. It
                emerged at the end of the <strong> 19th century</strong> in the <strong> United States</strong> and,
                over the
                years, expanded throughout the world.
                <br>
                The main characteristic of jazz is that it is not attached in a structured way to a score, but
                is based on
                <strong> improvisation</strong> and <strong> free interpretation</strong>. The usual thing,
                however, is for musicians to play a familiar theme within a certain harmonic framework, and let
                their imagination fly to decorate it and modify it according to inspiration.

            <h3>3. Rock and Roll</h3>

            <p>
                <strong> In the early fifties, another musician called "rock and roll" was in fashion. </strong> This
                style was created by musicians who could perform both R & B and Western Swing, a popular style of dance
                country music. He used the same instruments as the R & B of that time (electric guitar, double bass and
                drums), and had a touch of blues and R & B, but the melodies were more similar to those of country
                music.

            <h3>4. Pop</h3>

            <p>
                The <strong> pop music</strong> is a genre of popular music that originated in the late 1950s as an
                offshoot of pop traditional, in combination with other musical genres that were in vogue at the time.
                <BR>
                </br>
                As a genre, pop music is very eclectic, often borrowing elements from other styles such as urban,
                dance, rock, Latin music, rhythm and blues or folk. However, there are essential elements that define
                pop, such as short to medium-length songs, written in a basic format (often the structure verso -
                refrain ), as well as the usual use of repeated refrains, melodic themes and hooks. The instrumentation
                is usually composed of guitar, drums, bass, electric guitar, keyboard, synthesizer, etc.
