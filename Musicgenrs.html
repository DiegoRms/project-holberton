        <h1>Music genres</h1>
        <p>There is a great variety of musical genres, since music has evolved over time and each culture has developed
            its
            own musical styles.
        </p>
        <p>Below you can find some of the genres of music.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Música clásica</h3>
        <p><b>Classical music is a current that begins approximately in 1750 and ends in around 1820 </b>, in Europe.
            Hoy
            en día se asocia este tipo música a las personas serias, pues es una estilo culto, propio de un ambiente
            muy
            formal, refinado y elitista.

            Cuando alguien se imagina este tipo de música, rápidamente le viene a la mente la imagen de grandes
            orquestas,
            con muchos instrumentos, dirigidos por la figura de un director. La vestimenta es formal, con una imagen de
            respeto y seriedad. La música clásica se expresa en conciertos (solista que acompaña a la orquesta) y
            sinfonías
            (un coro de voces e instrumentos).

            Algunos de sus principales autores son Wagner, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, etcétera.

        <h3>2. Jazz</h3>
        <p>The jazz is a genre of music that originated in various rhythms and melodies Afro - Americans. It emerged at
            the
            end of the <b>19th century</b> in the <b>United States</b> and, over the years, expanded throughout the
            world.
            <br>
            The main characteristic of jazz is that it is not attached in a structured way to a score, but is based on
            <b>improvisation</b>
            and <b>free interpretation</b> . The usual thing, however, is for musicians to play a familiar theme within
            a
            certain harmonic framework, and let their imagination fly to decorate it and modify it according to
            inspiration.

        <h3>3. Rock and Roll</h3>
        <p>
            <b>In the early fifties, another musician called "rock and roll" was in fashion. </b> This style was
            created by
            musicians who could perform both R & B and Western Swing, a popular style of dance country music. He used
            the
            same instruments as the R & B of that time (electric guitar, double bass and drums), and had a touch of
            blues
            and R & B, but the melodies were more similar to those of country music.
